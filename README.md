# DB
First practice with database
Took 2days to figure out
Understood npm, nodemon, express more, at least how to track them using the terminal
Getting a clearer picture of api
I made a get, post, put, patch, and delete request in this mini project
In my frontend, i made a button that triggers the get function
The button uses the arr = Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length) to generate random objects from the array used as a mock database
I hope to get a better understanding of Node.js/Express.js
To access the project, type in http://localhost:3002/
